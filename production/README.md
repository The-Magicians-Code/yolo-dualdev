Scripts in this environment must be developed in such a way that they are capable of running both on x86 (PC) and arm (Jetson) architecture with minimal modifications, make sure that PyTorch versions match in torchinstall script and dev container to avoid incompatibiliy and version specific nuances on each architecture. model2trt.sh must be run on the specified device which performs inference, since TensorRT models are compiled for the specified GPU architecture.
